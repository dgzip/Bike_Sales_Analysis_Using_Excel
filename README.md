# Bike_Sales_Analysis_Using_Excel

In this project, I analyze bike sales over different geographies, age groups, gender, education, marital status, and other factors.
I created a working sheet to make required changes to our data, a pivot table sheet to have pivot tables, and finally a dashboard which contains the final visualizations.
